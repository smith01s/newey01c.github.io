title: A Guide to Aviation Acronyms for the Bamboozled
comments: true

This post will act as a reference for some of the most commonly-encountered
acronyms used in aviation and flight safety (at least, the ones that I happen
across regularly as a data scientist). This is necessary because aviation-y
types *love their acronyms* and it's a bit perplexing for someone with no
domain knowledge.

| **Acronym** | **Expansion** | **Notes** |
|:------------|:--------------|:----------|
| AAL | (Altitude) Above Airfield | Height of aircraft above airfield level. Reference altitude for takeoff and landing. |
| AMSL | (Altitude) Above Mean Sea Level | Height of aircraft above mean sea level. Reference altitude for cruise. |
| CCF | Control Column Force | |
| GPWS | Ground Proximity Warning System | |
| NOTAM | Notice to Airmen | A notice sent to an aviation authority warning pilots of potential hazards along a flight route. |
| SAT | [Static Air Temperature][SAT] | Temperature of air outside aircraft, discounting kinetic energy transferred from movement. Usually derived from TAT. Also known as OAT (Outside Air Temperature). |
| TAT | [Total Air Temperature][TAT] | Air temperature after being brought to rest by probe mounted on aircraft. Warmer than SAT due to kinetic energy being converted into thermal energy. |
| TAWS | Terrain Awareness Warning System | An alert that tells pilots if the aircraft is below a minimum altitude. |
| TFR | Temporary Flight Restriction | A temporarily restricted portion of airspace, due to hazardous conditions or special events. |

## Height, Altitude, or Elevation?

The distinction between these quantities always confuses me. I forget where I
found this quote, but it's very helpful when bamboozled.
